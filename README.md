## How it works?

After clicking the start button, a timer will display the remaining time to pick an answer.
Once an answer is selected it will display if it is right or wrong.
If none of the choices is selected, when the time is up, it will display the right answer for you.
At the end of the game, you will see the total of right, wrong, and unanswered questions.
